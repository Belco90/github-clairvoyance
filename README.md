_TODO: add demo gif here_

### Main Features:

- Group several releases by same type of changes for comparing them at once with ease

- Sort by different level of changes for [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), specially those using [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/)
- Spot original version where specific changes were introduced

### TODO:

- [ ] Autocomplete repo url input
- [ ] Search versions when typing on selects
- [ ] Restrict from and to versions when some option is selected
- [ ] Highlight other versioning system than Semantic Versioning
- [ ] Try to get changes from CHANGELOG.md if repository releases not available
- [ ] Retrieve more releases when repo has more than 100 available (pagination)
- [ ] Options to include pre-releases and drafts with filters
