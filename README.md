### Main Features:

- Filter by range of versions
- Group changes by normalized categories (e.g. put "bug fixes" and "minor" under the same group)
- Sort and prioritize by different level of changes for [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
- Highlight code blocks syntax and GitHub references
- Spot original version where specific changes were introduced

### Motivation
TODO

### Future Features:

- [ ] Autocomplete repo url input
- [ ] Search versions when typing on selects
- [ ] Restrict from and to version selects when some option is selected
- [ ] Group and sort other versioning system than Semantic Versioning
- [ ] Try to get changes from CHANGELOG.md if repository releases not available
- [ ] Retrieve more releases when repo has more than 100 available (pagination)
- [ ] Options to include pre-releases and drafts within filters
