### Main Features:

- Filter by range of versions
- Group changes by same category for comparing them at once with ease
- Highlight code blocks syntax and GitHub references
- Sort by different level of changes for [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), specially those using [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/)
- Spot original version where specific changes were introduced

### TODO:

- [ ] Autocomplete repo url input
- [ ] Search versions when typing on selects
- [ ] Restrict from and to version selects when some option is selected
- [ ] Group and sort other versioning system than Semantic Versioning
- [ ] Try to get changes from CHANGELOG.md if repository releases not available
- [ ] Retrieve more releases when repo has more than 100 available (pagination)
- [ ] Options to include pre-releases and drafts within filters
