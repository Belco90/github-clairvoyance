Previously `timeout` was always using the real clock while `interval` was using the global clock which could've been mocked out. For the old behavior I'd recommend `waitFor(callback, { interval, timeout: Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY })` and rely on your test runner to timeout considering real timers.\r\n* `<script />`, `<style />` and comment nodes are now ignored by default in `prettyDOM` .If you whish to return to the old behavior, use a custom `filterNode` function. In this case `prettyDOM(element, { filterNode: () => true })`.\r\n* node 10 is no longer supported. It reached its end-of-life on 30.04.2021.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Previously `timeout` was always using the real clock while `interval` was using the global clock which could've been mocked out. For the old behavior I'd recommend `waitFor(callback, { interval, timeout: Number.PositiveInfinity })` and rely on your test runner to timeout considering real timers.\n\n\n\n"

Fixing the issue should be straightforward. Here's an example from my (Kent's) own workaround:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n  // using fake timers to skip debounce time\r\n  jest.useFakeTimers()\r\n  userEvent.clear(notesTextarea)\r\n  userEvent.type(notesTextarea, newNotes)\r\n- act(() => jest.runAllTimers())\r\n\r\n  await screen.findByLabelText(/loading/i)\r\n  // wait for the loading spinner to go away\r\n  await waitForLoadingToFinish()\r\n\r\n  jest.useRealTimers()\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice that all I needed to change was removing manually advancing timers because now we handle things automatically for you 🎉"
