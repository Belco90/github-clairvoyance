/* Avoid clashing types between Cypress and Jest for linting files
(i.e. lint command)

Inspired by official solution #1:
https://docs.cypress.io/guides/tooling/typescript-support#Clashing-types-with-Jest

Also suggested by TypeScript ESLint (the last option):
https://typescript-eslint.io/docs/linting/typed-linting/#i-get-errors-telling-me-the-file-must-be-included-in-at-least-one-of-the-projects-provided

{
	"extends": "./tsconfig.json",
	// Include al TS files in the project, not just the ones inside src/
	// so cypress/ ones are linted.
	"include": [
		".eslintrc.js",
		"next-env.d.ts",
		"additional.d.ts",
		"**/*.ts",
		"**/*.tsx"
	],

	// Avoid excluding testing files for linting
	"exclude": []
}
